# fAST modERN mobro theme

I wanted this theme to be modern but also very easy to run on less capable hardware.

## Installation

Download the latest release.

## Screenshots

## Tested on:

| Board           | Usage |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Raspberry pi 3B |       |
| Raspberry pi A+ |       |

## Tech stack

Built with Preact and Redux to minimise DOM lookups. Also a big focus on memoization ( Maybe too much but ðŸ¤· )
