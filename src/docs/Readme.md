# ASTERN

## fAST modERN mobro theme

I wanted this theme to be modern and show some relevant stats like Core clock and Gpu stats but also very easy to run on less capable hardware.

## Installation

# windows

- Navigate to `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\MoBro\app-<version-number>\resources\resources\public\theme`
- Extract the all contents of the package there
- Restart MoBro server on your machine.
- The Theme should now be available
